# Hi everyone!!
My name is Maria!!
I'm currently working on trying to get certifications in Networking, trying to learn new things and discover new interests.
I'm currently learning Networking, SQL, Python and a little bit about cibersecurity. And so far it have been a great experience.
I'm new on GitHub so I don't know what to collaborate with, but I'm sure I'll find out soon.
I'm looking for people that share the same interests and can take some time to study with me, I feel it's very hard for me to concentrate when I'm by myself.
Ask me about anything, I don't know much about IT since I'm pretty new in the area but I'll try to help if I can.
Prounouns: She/Her.
Fun fact about me is that I'm from Brazil and now I'm living in Canada. I have a 14 years old dog and I like to play League of Legends!
